            Hello World! Iâ€™m Arsalane Otmane, a passionate Software Engineer who
            loves turning ideas into reality. My journey in technology began in
            high school when I wrote my first line of code, and Iâ€™ve been hooked
            ever since. I recently completed my engineering studies in Software
            Engineering, gaining hands-on experience in designing and delivering
            scalable, high-quality solutions through various internships and
            projects. These experiences have strengthened my problem-solving
            abilities and deepened my understanding of algorithms, software
            design, and systems architecture. I thrive on tackling complex
            challenges, quickly adapting to new tools and methodologies, and
            continuously expanding my knowledge. Beyond coding, I enjoy game
            development (which is still coding ðŸ˜Š), exploring creative ideas,
            and finding inspiration in diverse fields. I believe the best
            solutions come from a mix of technical expertise and out-of-the-box
            thinking, and I bring this mindset to everything I create. Iâ€™m
            always open to new challenges, collaborations, and opportunities to
            grow. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just
            chat about tech!
