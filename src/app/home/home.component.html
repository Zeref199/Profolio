                <p style="padding-top: 5%;">   Hello World! I'm Arsalane Otmane, a passionate Software Engineering student who loves turning ideas into reality. 
                    My journey in the tech world started when I wrote my first line of code in high school, and I've been hooked ever since.

                    I'm currently pursuing my degree in Software Engineering, where I've had the opportunity to deepen my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and software design principles. 
                    I'm particularly interested in Spring And Angular, and I enjoy exploring new technologies and tools in this area.

                    When I'm not coding, you can find me immersed in the world of game development (wich is still coding ðŸ˜Š), fostering my creativity and keeping my inspiration ignited. 
                    I believe that the best software solutions come from a blend of technical knowledge and out-of-the-box thinking, and I strive to bring this perspective to all my projects.

                    I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just chat about tech!
